# Development

**Important Instructions For Source Control**:

- Create **branch** for every development/fixes tasks
  - For feature development create a branch with prefix `feat/`
  - For bug fixes create a branch with prefix `fix/`
- DO NOT push on **master or staging** branches directly, instead create a PRs.
- DO NOT merge any PRs before review.
- Before any branch creation from **staging** branch, make sure to pull the latest changes

# How to create branch and start working

   ```bash
   git switch staging
   git pull origin staging
   git switch -c feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. After completing your work, push your branch to remote
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to staging branch on GitHub for review and merging.

4. After PR is approved and merged, switch back to staging branch and pull the latest changes
   ```bash
   git switch staging
   git pull origin staging
   ```
